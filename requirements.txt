This implementation allows admins to assign permissions to roles and ensure users can access services based on their roles. The `Permission` and `RolePermission` models manage permission definitions and associations with roles. The `PermissionService` provides the necessary business logic to manage permissions, while controllers and routes handle the API endpoints. Admin-only access control is implemented via decorators, and the front end includes functionality for creating permissions. The database schema is updated to include tables for permissions and role-permission relationships.
