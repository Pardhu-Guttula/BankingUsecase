This implementation ensures that users can securely upload documents when submitting requests. The `DocumentService` handles the storage and retrieval of uploaded documents, while the front-end code facilitates the file upload process. The `Document` model captures metadata about the uploads, and the necessary database schema is created using a SQL file. The document upload endpoint integrates with existing application architecture through registration in `app.py`.
