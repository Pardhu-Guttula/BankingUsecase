This implementation allows users to save their incomplete applications and resume them later. The `IncompleteApplication` model stores the form data, and the `ApplicationService` handles saving and retrieving the progress. The front-end code allows users to save their progress and load it back when they resume the application. The necessary database schema is created using a SQL file, and the routes are registered in `app.py`.
