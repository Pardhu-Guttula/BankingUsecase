This implementation ensures secure transmission of data between the portal and the core banking system. The `core_banking_controller` handles API requests, utilizing JWT authentication for secure access. Proper security measures such as input validation and secure transmission protocols are employed. The `middleware` folder contains reusable decorators to secure routes, ensuring that API endpoints are both secure and well-organized. The database schema includes a `users` table to handle user data securely.
