This implementation adds an email service to send notifications for significant updates on user requests. The email service is integrated into the existing status update logic, ensuring that users receive notifications via email and real-time updates through WebSocket connections. The configuration settings for the email server are added to `app.py`, and the routes are registered appropriately.
