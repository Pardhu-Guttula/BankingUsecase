This implementation ensures that users receive in-app notifications for significant updates on their requests. The `NotificationService` handles creating and retrieving notifications, and the front-end code displays these notifications in real-time using WebSocket events. The email notifications are managed alongside the in-app notifications for a comprehensive update system.
