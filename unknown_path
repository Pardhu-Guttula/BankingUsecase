To ensure users can upload documents securely when submitting requests, we will:

1. Create an endpoint for document upload.
2. Implement logic to handle file uploads and secure storage.
3. Store metadata about the uploaded documents in the database.
4. Implement front-end code to allow users to upload documents.

1. Define the `Document` model.
2. Create a service for handling document uploads.
3. Create API routes to upload and view documents.
4. Add front-end code to upload documents.

Let's proceed with the implementation.
