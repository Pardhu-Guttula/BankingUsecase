To enable users to save progress on incomplete applications and resume them later, we will:

1. Create a model to store the incomplete application data.
2. Implement a service to handle saving and retrieving application progress.
3. Create API endpoints to save and retrieve incomplete applications.
4. Add front-end code to save progress and resume incomplete applications.

We will implement the following steps:

1. Define the `IncompleteApplication` model.
2. Implement the service for saving and retrieving incomplete applications.
3. Create API routes to save and retrieve incomplete applications.
4. Add front-end code to handle saving and resuming applications.

Let's proceed with the implementation.
