To provide real-time status updates on user requests, we need to integrate WebSockets with Flask to push updates to the client-side whenever the status of a request changes.

Epic Title: Real-time Status Updates

We will:
1. Set up a WebSocket server using Flask-SocketIO.
2. Create the necessary models to track request statuses.

2. Implement WebSocket communication on the server-side.
3. Create the front-end logic to handle real-time updates.
