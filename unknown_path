To develop secure APIs for integration between the portal and the core banking system, we will:

1. Create secure routes for API endpoints.
2. Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms.
3. Use appropriate security practices such as input validation and secure transmission of data.
4. Ensure API endpoints are structured correctly and follow RESTful principles.

Epic Title: Core Banking System Integration

Given the folder structure and user story, we will:
1. Set up routes for API endpoints.
2. Implement controllers to handle core banking system interactions.
3. Implement security measures such as JWT authentication.
4. Ensure data is securely transmitted.

Let's proceed with the implementation:
